Algorithm 5 CDS-Based Color Assignment
1) Compute the node connectivity k of G. Identify k^CDS =
Ω(k/ log^2 n) node-disjoint CDS using the algorithm
in [19].
2) Assign the same color to all the nodes in a CDS. If nc ≥
k^CDS, assign a distinct color to each CDS. If nc < k^CDS,
assign a distinct color to each of nc CDS, and assign an
arbitrary color to each remaining CDS.
