Specifically, the EM algorithm can be implemented in the following four
steps.
1) Initialization: We set the initial interaction matrix as
B^(0). In order to avoid ignoring any useful information,
we assume that any failed components in generation g is
the cause of the component failures in generation g + 1.
Then the initial matrix A^(0) âˆˆ ZnÃ—n can be obtained
from all original cascades and B^(0) can be calculated
from A^(0) by using (1).
Note that the assumption here tends to overestimate the
component interactions. This is because a component
that fails before the failure of another component may
not be the cause of that particular failure. However, it
is appropriate to use A^(0) to get the initial guess for
B since in this way we will not miss any interaction
between component failures. As mentioned in Section
III-B, running the algorithm for multiple times by using
different initial parameters may help to get the solution
with global optimum. However, in this paper we do not
need to do so, because the chosen A^(0) has a clear
physical meaning and is a good initial parameter. This
will be validated by the test results in Section VI.
2) E-step: Estimate A^(k+1) based on B^(k).
For any two successive nonzero generations g, g + 1 of
any cascade m, under the condition that component j
has failed, the component j failure in generation g + 1
is caused by component i âˆˆ F^(m) g in generation g by
probability

p^(k+1)m,g ij = b^(k) ij / 1 âˆ’ lâˆˆF^(m) g  (1 âˆ’ b^(k) lj ). (5)
If i /âˆˆ F^(m) g , p^(k+1)m,g ij  = 0. For example, for the two
consecutive generations shown in Fig. 3, there is
pAD = bAD
1 âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ bAD)(1 âˆ’ bBD)(1 âˆ’ bCD)
, (6)
and pAE, pBD, pBE, pCD, and pCE can also be written
in a similar manner.
The updated entry of A^(k+1) can be obtained as the
summation over all consecutive nonzero generations for
all cascades 
a^(k+1) ij  = Mu m=1  G^m âˆ’2 g=0  p^(k+1)m,g ij , (7)
where G^m is the number of generations with nonzero
number of outages in cascade m.
3) M-step: Estimate B^(k+1) based on A^(k+1).
After A^(k+1) is obtained, the updated interaction matrix
B^(k+1) can be calculated by using (1).
4) End: Iterate the E-step and M-step until

||B^(k+1) ij  âˆ’ B^(k) ij  ||F  /âˆšNnonzero  <e , (8)
where ||X||F is the Frobenius norm of a u Ã— v matrix X defined as
||X||F = âˆš(u i=1  v j=1  |Xij|^2), (9)
Nnonzero is the number of nonzero elements in B^(k+1)ij âˆ’ B^(k) ij , e is the tolerance, and the B^(k+1) ij that satisfies (8)
will be the estimated interaction matrix.
