Algorithm 6 Assign Nodes Vi Into |Vi|/nsj 	 Full Groups of
Size nsj
1) Sort the h disjoint CDS in the ascending order of their
sizes. Denote the nodes in the l-th CDS in Gi by N^l,l = 1, 2,...,h.

2) For l from 1 to h, start with an empty group if available,
and assign nodes from N^l into the group. Repeat until
all nodes are assigned. If there are not enough empty
groups, assign the rest nodes into occupied groups until
these groups become full.
3) The algorithm terminates when the [|Vi|/nsj]	 groups
become full.
