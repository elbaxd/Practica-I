Algorithm 3 Computation of the Global Minimum Color
Node Cut of G Where G[Vi] Is Connected ∀i
1) Compute minimum color st node cut Cst c for all nonadjacent st pairs in G by Algorithm 2. Let C1 c denote
the minimum size Cst c over all st pairs. (The cut C1 c is
the minimum color node cut of G that partitions G into
more than one component.)
2) Compute the minimum set of colors C2 c that cover at
least n − 1 out of the n nodes in G. (I.e., if there exists
a color i that is carried by one node, then C2 c include
all the colors except color i. If there is no color that is
carried by a single node, then C2 c include all the colors.)
3) The minimum color node cut of G is given by the
smaller of C1 c and C2 c .
