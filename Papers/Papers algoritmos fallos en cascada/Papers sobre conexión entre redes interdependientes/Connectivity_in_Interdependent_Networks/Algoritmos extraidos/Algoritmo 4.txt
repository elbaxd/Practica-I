Algorithm 4 Path-Based Color Assignment
1) Compute the st node connectivity k^st. Identify kst nodedisjoint st paths.
2) Assign the same color to all the nodes in a path. If nc â‰¥
k^st, assign a distinct color to each path. If nc < k^st,
assign a distinct color to each of nc paths, and assign
an arbitrary color to each remaining path.
