Algorithm 1 Transformation From the Demand Graph G1 to
a Colored Graph G˜1
1) If a node vi ∈ G1 has ns(vi) supply nodes, ns(vi)
copies of vi exist in G˜1. Each copy has a color which
identifies a supply node. No edge exists between the
copies of vi.
2) If vi and vj are connected by an edge in G1, then all
the copies of vi are connected to all the copies of vj
in G˜1.
